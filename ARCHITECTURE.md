# Conqueror Engine (Revised) Architecture

This document describes the architecture of the Conqueror Engine (Revised) project, detailing its core components, module interactions, and overall design principles. It serves as a guide for developers to understand, maintain, and extend the project.

## 1. Overview

Conqueror Engine (Revised) is a high-performance, modular game engine focused on nation-building simulation in a browser environment. It combines C++ game logic compiled to WebAssembly (WASM) with modern JavaScript front-end components, enabling robust performance and smooth interactivity.

## 2. Core Components

### 2.1 WebAssembly Modules
- **`game_engine.cpp`:**  
  Contains the core game logic, including unit simulation, A* pathfinding, and structural subsystems. It is compiled to a WASM module (`game_engine.wasm`) using Emscripten.
  
- **`gameplay_stitched.cpp`:**  
  Integrates additional gameplay features and assets, compiled into its own WASM module (`gameplay_stitched.wasm`). This module allows separation of gameplay logic from core engine functionality.

### 2.2 JavaScript Integration
- **`engine-import.js`:**  
  An ES module that orchestrates the initialization process. Responsibilities include:
  - Extracting URL parameters (lobby codes and configuration).
  - Establishing a Socket.IO connection for real-time interactions.
  - Concurrently loading WASM modules and invoking their entry points.
  - Managing fallback logic for Leaflet-based map rendering.
  
- **`game-loader.js`:**  
  A lightweight loader that imports and invokes the initialization function from `engine-import.js`. It logs essential runtime information, providing a clear startup sequence.

### 2.3 Front-End and UI Components
- **`index.html`:**  
  The primary entry point for the browser. It:
  - Integrates external libraries (Leaflet CSS/JS, Socket.IO).
  - Provides a professional loading screen that transitions to the game view once initialization is complete.
  - Embeds the main script that triggers engine initialization.
  
- **`style.css`:**  
  Contains styling rules for the overall appearance of the application, including the loading screen, notifications, and responsive design adjustments.

### 2.4 Server and Deployment
- **Docker and Nginx:**  
  A **Dockerfile** is provided to build a container with Nginx serving the built assets from the `dist/` directory. Custom configurations like **nginx.conf** ensure proper MIME types and caching policies are applied.
  
- **Build and Execution Scripts:**  
  - **`build.sh`:** A shell script to compile both WASM modules with Emscripten and place outputs in `dist/`.
  - **`run.sh`:** Launches a local development server to serve built files.
  - **Terminal and Makefile commands:** Documented collectively in **TERMINAL_COMMANDS.md** for reproducible workflows.

## 3. External Dependencies

- **Emscripten:**  
  Transforms C++ source code into WebAssembly, exposing specific runtime methods required for module interaction.
  
- **Leaflet:**  
  Provides interactive mapping capabilities. A fallback initialization is available if the main engine does not instantiate a map.
  
- **Socket.IO:**  
  Enables realâ€‘time communication between clients and the server, managing lobby functions and dynamic map updates.
  
- **Socket.IO CDN and Additional Libraries:**  
  CDN-hosted external scripts support rapid runtime integration. Google Fonts and custom styling ensure visual consistency.

## 4. Module Interactions

The architecture is designed to separate concerns:
- **C++ WASM Modules** handle computationally intensive logic, ensuring performance.
- **JavaScript Modules** act as glue, handling UI rendering, network communication, and error handling.
- **HTML & CSS** manage user experience and view transitions, ensuring the application remains responsive and robust on different devices.

## 5. Build and Deployment Workflow

1. **Local Development:**
   - Use the provided **Makefile** or **build.sh** to compile and generate WebAssembly modules.
   - Launch the application locally with **run.sh** to verify functionality.
   
2. **Continuous Integration:**
   - GitHub Actions (configured in `.github/workflows/build.yml`) validates builds and artifacts on every commit to the `revised` branch.
   
3. **Containerized Deployment:**
   - Build a Docker image using the provided **Dockerfile**.
   - Deploy the container, ensuring the server is set to serve static files from the `dist/` directory with proper caching and MIME type handling.

## 6. Future Enhancements and Roadmap
- **Modular Expansion:**  
  New gameplay features can be developed as separate modules and integrated without affecting core engine stability.
  
- **Performance Optimization:**  
  Continuous profiling of WASM modules and fine-tuning of JavaScript interactions for lower latency.
  
- **Enhanced Real-Time Features:**  
  Improved networking capabilities and more dynamic map updates leveraging the Socket.IO ecosystem.
