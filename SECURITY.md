# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The Conqueror Engine project follows a regular release cycle. Only officially released versions and their patched updates are supported from a security perspective.

- **Supported Version:** 1.0.0 and later
- **End of Life Versions:** Any version that has reached EOL will not receive security updates.

## Security Measures

We take security very seriously. The project is built using industry-standard practices, including:
- Regular code reviews and security audits by maintainers
- Use of up-to-date libraries and tools (e.g., Emscripten for WebAssembly, Socket.IO for real-time communication)
- Preloading assets securely using Emscriptenâ€™s virtual filesystem to limit exposure to file-based vulnerabilities
